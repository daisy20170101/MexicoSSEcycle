# MexicoSSEcycle
Description: data products of Mexico long-term slow slip cycles simulation

## Scripts
Scripts to create parameter files used in the simulation.

## Data
Data products of Cascadia megathrust rupture model.

### Mesh

We build the discretized fault surface based on the 3D plate geometry from Perez et al.[2018]. The fault is 350 km along the strike and extends from trench to 60 km. 
The mesh file contains 90496 triangular elements with a length of ~1.5 km.
