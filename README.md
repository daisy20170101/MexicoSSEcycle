# MexicoSSEcycle
Description: data products of Mexico long-term slow slip cycles simulation

## Data

Data products of Cascadia megathrust rupture model.

#### Mesh

We build the discretized fault surface based on the 3D plate geometry from Perez et al.[2018]. The fault is ~400 km along the strike and extends from trench to 60 km. 
The mesh file contains 90,496 triangular elements with a length of ~1.5 km. 

#### ParameterSetup

1) Distribution of Non-dimension parameter a-b and effective normal stress
2) Length of velocity-weakening in SSE source region (W)

#### Spatio-temporal distribution of slip rate

Slip rate on the fault as shown in Figure 3a. 

#### Slip distrinbution

1) Cumulative slip of four SSEs as shown in Figure 4.
2) Slip budget on the fault as shown in Figure 3d.


#### GPS (Surface deformation)

1) Observations from Radiguet et al. [2012] and Radiguet et al. [2016]
2) Synthetic GPS vectors as shown in Figure 4.

#### Source properties (Moment-duration scaling relation)

Duration and seismic moment of modeled SSEs as shown in Figure 3e.  

## Movies

Snapshots of the four modeled SSEs shown in Figure 4.
